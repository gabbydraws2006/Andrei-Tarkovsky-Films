            <p style="color: white;">Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky 
                 was a Russian film director and screenwriter. Widely considered one of the greatest and most 
                 influential directors in cinema history, Tarkovsky's films explore spiritual and metaphysical themes, 
                 and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, 
                 and preoccupation with nature and memory.

                Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's VGIK under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, and subsequently 
                directed his first five features in the Soviet Union: Ivan's Childhood (1962), Andrei Rublev (1966), Solaris (1972), Mirror (1975), 
                and Stalker (1979). A number of his films from this period are ranked among the best films ever made. 
                After years of creative conflict with state film authorities, Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 
                and made his final two films abroad; Nostalghia (1983) and The Sacrifice (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden respectively.
