                is a 1979 Soviet science fantasy art film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky with a screenplay written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, 
                loosely based on their 1972 novel Roadside Picnic. The film tells the story of an expedition 
                led by a figure known as the "Stalker" (Alexander Kaidanovsky), who guides his two clients—a melancholic writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn) seeking inspiration, and a professor (Nikolai Grinko) seeking scientific discovery—through a hazardous wasteland to a mysterious restricted site known simply as the "Zone", 
                where there supposedly exists a room which grants a person's innermost desires.

                <h2 style="color: white;">Andrei Rublev (Андрей Рублёв)  </h2>
            <p style="color: white;"> 
                 is a 1966 Soviet epic biographical historical drama film.
                The film was re-edited from the 1966 film titled The Passion According to Andrei by Tarkovsky which was censored 
                during the first decade of the Brezhnev era in the Soviet Union. The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, 
                a 15th-century Russian icon painter. The film features Anatoly Solonitsyn, Nikolai Grinko, Ivan Lapikov, Nikolai Sergeyev, 
                Nikolai Burlyayev and Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush.
